Example Workflow:

1. Admin creates permissions for different API endpoints
2. Admin creates subscription plans with different permission sets
3. Users register and subscribe to plans
4. Users access API services based on their subscription permissions
5. The system tracks usage and enforces rate limits
6. Users can view their usage statistics
7. Admins can monitor and manage all users, plans, and permissions
